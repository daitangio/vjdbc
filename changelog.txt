VJDBC Change-Log
================

FEA = Implemented feature
BUG = Resolved bug
OPT = Optimization
CLN = Cleanup/Refactoring
OTH = Other

Release 1.7.0 (06 Feb 2010)
---------------------------
* FEA: Upgraded source base to JDBC4 and JDK 1.6
* BUG: Fixed bug in the metadata classes which routed a ReflectiveCommand to the wrong server side JDBC class
* FEA: Added the ability to manually insert a JDBC object into the server side connection so more than just an id can be returned to the client
* OTH: upgraded to Apache Commons DBCP 1.4 (from 1.2.1)

Release 1.6.5 (05 Feb 2007)
---------------------------
* FEA: ServletCommandSink now searches the whole classpath for the configuration resource
* FEA: Using Doug Lea's PooledExecutor for asynchronously reading of remaining ResultSets instead
       of starting a thread each time
* FEA: PreparedStatement.set<...>Stream methods accept -1 as the length parameter. It is then
       replaced by the actual length of the InputStream read by VJDBC
* FEA: Support for Oracle's ROWID type
* FEA: Added support for variable expansion in configuration file (thx to Chris Campbell), see
       reference for details
* BUG: Fixed possible race condition in ResultSetHolder (thx to John V. Sichi)
* BUG: Fixed server-side NPE in finalizer of StreamingResultSet (thx again to John V. Sichi)
* OTH: Changed contact email address to vjdbc@gmx.net

Release 1.6.4 (19 Aug 2006)
---------------------------
* FEA: Jakarta-HttpClient can be used as a drop-in replacement for the JDK classes. See chapter
       'Client-Side Properties' for more information.
* FEA: HTTP-Request can now be enhanced with own request headers by implementing a RequestEnhancer that
       is called back before the actual HTTP-Request is made. See chapter 'Using Request-Enhancers' in
       the reference documentation.
* FEA: In Servlet-Mode the location of the config resource can be configured by setting the init 
       parameter 'config-resource' in the web.xml of the VJDBC-Servlet.
* FEA: RMI-Configuration now supports the remotingPort-Attribute to specify which server port is used by
       the remote objects to listen for incoming client requests.
* FEA: Statement.cancel() can be called asynchronously to interrupt running queries (if supported by the
       native database driver)
* FEA: VJDBC-URLs now can use other split characters than comma
* BUG: Vendor-specific SQLExceptions were sliced of their information (thx again to John V. Sichi)
* BUG: Setting scale of BigDecimal in the StreamingResultSet
* CLN: RMI-Configuration attribute 'port' was renamed to 'registryPort' because of the mixup with the new
       'remotingPort' attribute. 'port' is still supported to prevent breaking changes.
* CLN: Upgraded to the current Jakarta-Commons libraries

Release 1.6.3 (08 Apr 2006)
---------------------------
* FEA: Now using SVN-Support of SourceForge
* CLN: Classes in de.simplicit.vjdbc are now public. Some tools (i.e. Spring) seem to have problems when 
       they access these classes via reflection without using the public JDBC-Interfaces (thx to Anton Keks)
* CLN: CommandSinks now must support a close-Method for cleanup
* BUG: New Shutdown-Hook destroys CommandProcessor-Singleton
* BUG: StreamingResultSet.getTimestamp(int columnIndex, Calendar cal) caused ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
       because columnIndex was corrected twice
* BUG: VirtualStatement.executeQuery() didn't remember ResultSet, thus calls to getResultSet() returned null
* BUG: PreparedStatementUpdateCommand didn't work with Null-Parameters (i. e. pure Out-Parameters of Stored-Procs)

Release 1.6.2 (10 Dec 2005)
---------------------------
* BUG: Multiple execution of Statement.execute(sql) + Statement.getResultSet() returned empty ResultSet
* BUG: ServletCommandSinkClient didn't accept null-UIDs which caused the KeepAliveTimerTask to terminate
       (thx to dbaldes)
* BUG: Initialization throws a ConfigurationException when connection pooling is turned on and no 
       user/password is provided. This makes VJDBC more secure as otherwise user-provided accounts were 
       accidently shared via connection pooling.
* CLN: Multiple initialization of VJDBC doesn't throw an exception anymore but emits a warning and ignores
       the second initialization. This makes it easier for server developers to test their stuff without
       stopping the VM.
* CLN: Changed the behaviour of Query-Filters; when a statement doesn't match any filter it isn't executed
       anymore because this allowed malicious statements to accidently get through the filter chain. The rule
       now is: if at least one filter is specified the statement MUST match one of the filters.

Release 1.6.1 (11 Oct 2005)
---------------------------
* BUG: Null-Check in PreparedStatementExecuteCommand, parameters can be null in the case of OUT
       parameters of CallableStatments
* BUG: Derived SQLExceptions caused endless recursion in SQLExceptionHelper
* BUG: CallableStatement.getObject() can return a ResultSet which must be handled using a StreamingResultSet
* BUG: Fixed bug in BigDecimal handling of StreamingResultSet
* OPT: Minor adjustments in Build-File
* OPT: Removed obsolete class StatementCopyCommand

Release 1.6 (24 Aug 2005)
-------------------------
* FEA: The Orphaned-Connection-Collector-Task (aka OCCT) can now be configured with the new <occt>-Tag
* OPT: Unified Exception-Handling
* OPT: Changed synchronization on server-side connection entries to be more scalable
* OPT: Other minor changes
* BUG: Fixed minor error in a logging statement when the connection for a command couldn't be found
* BUG: Reworked Exception-Handling in Servlet-Sink completely to support meaningful SQLExceptions on the
       client-side

Release 1.5 (26 Jun 2005)
-------------------------
* BUG: The asynchronous reading of RowPackets didn't work correctly when the subsequent 
       NextRowPacket-Request was made before the reading of the RowPacket was finished (thx
       to Anton Keks for pointing me to this problem).
* BUG: Methods first() and last() on an empty StreamingResultSet caused NullPointer-Exception
* OPT: Changed SQLException handling to provide more information for the client
* OPT: Some small optimizations
* OPT: Removed "Average Time in Commands" statistics (didn't make any sense because of the
       different kinds of commands)

Release 1.4 (11 Jun 2005)
-------------------------
* OPT: RowPackets are now loaded asynchronously. While the client processes a RowPacket the
       server reads the next RowPacket which can be delivered instantly with the next Remote-Call.
* OPT: Changed expensive instanceof-Calls in StreamingResultset into switch-Statements
* FEA: Implemented getRef()-API
* FEA: Improved support for ad-hoc conversions within StreamingResultSet (thx to Erik Jõgi)
* FEA: Long running database operations were accidently terminated by the OrphanedConnectionCollectorTask.
       This is now prevented by marking the connection as active.
* FEA: Now it can be specified which client-side system properties are delivered to the server for
       logging purposes. You must pass a VJdbc-Property with the getConnection-Method (take a look
       at chapter 3.4 of the reference documentation)
* CLN: Removed obsolete classes
* BUG: CallableStatementGetObjectCommand didn't handle Null-Results correctly
* BUG: Resolved Named-Queries were sometimes checked against Query-Filters

Release 1.3 (26 Mar 2005)
-------------------------
* BUG: Fixed serious bug in RowPacket implementation which caused exceptions when the size
       of a ResultSet wasn't a multiple of RowPacket-Size (thx to Blas Rodriguez Somoza)
* OPT: Switched the remaining Serializable classes (Parameters, ResultSetMetaData) to 
       Externalizable usage
* FEA: Configuration was extended to provide parameters for the underlying DBCP-Pooling
       (see reference, chapter 3.2 for details)
* CLN: Small corrections to reference guide

Release 1.2.1 (12 Mar 2005)
---------------------------
* BUG: Fixed small bug in JavaVersionInfo that could cause exceptions when using JDK 1.5

Release 1.2 (27 Feb 2005)
-------------------------
* OPT: reworked RowPacket implementation completely: data isn't delivered as rows with
       mixed types but as columns with fixed types. This results in a reduction of data
       to transport and much faster serialisation when primitive types are part of the 
       ResultSet. Memory consumption seems also to be much better as bigger blocks of
       continous memory are allocated instead of many small objects.
* OPT: HashMaps in StreamingResultSet were replaced by String arrays which are faster
       during serialization
* OPT: removed Tracing-Possibility in DestroyCommand, was too expensive
* OPT: SerializableTransport is now Externalizable (faster than Serializable)
* BUG: Support for Types.BOOLEAN
* BUG: Fixed typo in PreparedStatementExecuteCommand
* BUG: Fixed Quickstart-Documentation

Release 1.1 (14 Jan 2005)
-------------------------
* FEA: PreparedStatement.execute() is now supported
* CLN: Removed object pooling for serialization; today's JVM are very good at reducing
       the costs for object creation
* BUG: In some rare cases ReflectiveCommand didn't use the correct JDBC interface
       class for introspection

Release 1.0 (06 Jan 2005)
-------------------------
* FEA: Implemented support for DataSource API (see config-element dataSourceFactory)
* FEA: The calling context of orphaned objects like Statements or ResultSets can 
       now be traced back to the origin. That way potential resource "leaks" caused by 
       not closing JDBC objects can be traced easily.
* FEA: User/Password for the database connection can now be specified in the configuration.
       The client mustn't provide them anymore but instead use a custom login mechanism or
       no login at all.
* FEA: Named-Queries for replacing real SQL queries with string identifiers
* FEA: Query-Filters can filter the SQL-Statements using a chain of regular expressions.
       With Query-Filters malicious statements (drop table, etc.) can be rejected by VJDBC.
* FEA: extended validation of the Connection-Configuration
* FEA: ResultSetMetaData can be optionally prefetched
* BUG: Statement.getConnection() now returns the VJDBC-Connection object instead
       of trying to get the connection from the remote object
* BUG: Some methods of the JDBC-Interface didn't pass their parameters to the server
* BUG: DestroyCommand used to call close() method directly on the target objects instead of
       using the JDBC interfaces for the Reflection-Call
* OPT: Replaced String-UID with Integer-UID, easier to read in the logfiles and probably little
       bit faster to serialize
* CLN: Added missing serial ids to some serializable classes
* CLN: Removed obsolete method 'lastProcessedCommand' of DecoratedCommandSink
* CLN: Extended logging
* CLN: Updated all third-party-libraries to their current version

Release 0.9.0 (16 May 2004)
---------------------------
* Speed improvements
    - switched from standard Serialization to Externalizable-Usage
    - UID-Objects for C/S exchange now more compact
    - ResultSetMetaData will now only be delivered on-demand
* Redesign of configuration
    - can now be done completely programmatically with a bunch of Configuration objects
    - configuration files now in XML format (using Jakarta-Digester)
    - multiple Connections can now be served by a VJDBC server
    - Properties (compression, rowpacketsize, login, ...) can now be handled per Connection
    - Client doesn't need to know all those server properties anymore
* BUG: forgot cleaning up resources in the Servlet-Sink (thx to Heiko Wenzel)
* BUG: Auto-Commit-Handling was wrong
* BUG: finalize() of VirtualPreparedStatement was obsolete (and wrong)
* BUG: ReflectiveCommand now uses the java.sql-Interfacetypes for calling the reflected
       methods instead of calling directly the implementing classes (got IllegalAccessErrors
       from Oracle-Driver)
* FEA: ResultSets now contain only the last requested RowPacket when the ResultSet-Type
       is forward-only. Otherwise the client could run out of memory in case of big
       ResultSets (thx to Hank Drews)
* FEA: ResultSet.getBinaryStream() implemented, Charset for String-to-byte[]-Conversion
       can be specified on server-side (defaults to "ISO-8859-1" which is used i. e. in
       MySQL 4.0)
* FEA: Support for SQL-Types Array and Struct improved
* VJDBC passes all unit tests of Hibernate 2.1.2 (VJDBC + MySQL as backend database)
* Some small bugfixes and internal cleanup

Release 0.8.3 (08 February 2004)
--------------------------------
* Switched from Log4J to Commons-Logging
* New property vjdbc.database.allowcustom: with this flag set to false you can prevent a
    client from connecting to a database other than the one specified by vjdbc.database
* Support for connection pooling with Jakarta-DBCP; use vjdbc.connectionpooling for turning
    it on/off (default is on)
* Moved all server-specific classes and interfaces in a separate package called
    de.simplicit.vjdbc.server; adjusted build to generate separate jars, too
* Reduced size of distribution by stripping down the J2EE and Rowset jars to the
    necessary classes
* Reworked Servlet-Client a little bit

Release 0.8.2 (06 January 2004)
-------------------------------
* BUG: DatabaseMetaData.getIndexInfo() caused NoSuchMethodException (thx to Fredrik Bertilsson)
* FEA: RMI-ConnectionServer can now be instantiated and VJdbcProperties can be initialized
       with own PropertiesLoader-Implementation (thx again to Fredrik Bertilsson)

Release 0.8.1 (04 January 2004)
-------------------------------
Initial release.
